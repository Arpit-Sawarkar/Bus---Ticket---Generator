# Bus Ticket Generator (Python)

Bus Ticket Generator System designed for Amravati city’s local transport, built using Python and Tkinter!
This project simulates a real-time bus ticket booking system, featuring:

🔹 Conductor Interface: For entering journey details like source, destination, and number of full/half tickets.
🔹 Passenger Ticket View: A popup window displaying a formatted ticket receipt with journey details, fare, and timestamp.

◾Tech highlights:
○ Developed with Python 3 and Tkinter (GUI + ttk.Combobox)
○ Implemented functions for fare calculation and ticket generation
○ Used lists for managing city data
○ Integrated datetime for real-time ticket generation
○ Added exception handling for input validation

This project helped me understand how real-world ticketing systems can be built using simple yet effective logic and GUI design.
